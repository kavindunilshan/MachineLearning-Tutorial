The first column refers to the number of likes received by each post (standardized between to the interval $[0, 1]$), the columns after that will denote the presence of a certain word (token) in the text of the post. For example, a $1$ in the column \"TextToken_life\" denotes that the particular post contained the word \"life\" in it and $0$ otherwise. These will be the features of our dataset. Our aim is to cluster these social media posts based on number of likes and words contained in it."
